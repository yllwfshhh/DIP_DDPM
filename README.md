# DIP_DDPM
GAI HW4 112-2
I run this project on colab.
This DIP model part,it should load dataset from website and generate initial priors, then save them in Google Drive.

Here is the DDPM part:

The difference of DDPM and DIP + DDPM architecture is how to load the dataset.
DDPM use the dataset online while DIP + DDPM run my own generated initial priors folder.

If you want to run DDPM, uncomment the green sections, else these parts should work for DIP + DDPM.
Remember to comment the one which works for DIP + DDPM.
